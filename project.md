Final Project
=============

You will design a final research project by yourself or with one or two other
students with guidance from us. Unlike the Machine Translation course, all
projects mush be empirical. As such, all projects 
must clearly define a research problem and an experimental procedure with 
input, output, and evaluation measures. You should make an appointment with
the instructors to discuss your project prior to the interim report. To
keep you on track, there are three presentations (proposal/interim/final) with
two reports (interim being a subset of the final):

<!-- * BEFORE October 19: Meet with your instructors, by [appointment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DVmTdxl9WqlrV7VVZB5uw5ix5WtnEmfGLrGk2JHueUo/edit?usp=sharing). -->
* February 6: Project proposals (5% of course grade)
* March 28: Interim report due (5% of course grade)
* March  28: Mid-Point presentations (10% of course grade)
* May 16: Final project presentations (10% of course grade)
* May 23: Final write-up (20% of course grade)

Project Proposal
----------------
Your project proposal should be ready at the start of class on February 7th.
Groups will be randomly selected to present and you may not end up presenting
until the 8th. Unlike the Machine Translation course, you are not required
to meet with the instructor before the project proposal and there is no
written proposal. However, by the mid-point checkpoint, a much more formal
research proposal will be due and your group will need to meet with the
instructor at least once before then.

<!-- Your project proposal must identify a concrete research plan. A survey
proposal must clearly identify:

* A coherent research area related to machine translation. The research
area could be organized around a specific application, a technical 
problem, or a coherent set of methods for solving problems. The area
should be one that has not been surveyed before, or at least not 
recently.

* A set of initial papers to be surveyed.

* An outline of the themes that you expect to find, and questions that
you hope to learn answers to.

An empirical proposal must clearly idenfity:

* A single problem related to machine translation. Your problem should
be illustrated with an example and stated formally, ideally in the first
paragraph.

* An outline of your project. How will you solve the problem? What models 
and algorithms will you implement? What software will you use? 

* An experimental design. How will you know if you solved the problem?
You should clearly identify input, output, and evaluation measures.

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, we expect
you to implement it and analyze the results, and we will give you full 
credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a weak proposal, 
you can revise it and resubmit it before moving forward. But the longer you 
take to define your project, the less time you will have to implement it, so
do the best you can for this early checkpoint. -->

The goal of the project proposal is to foster research presentation skills
that are key for future success in the field of Multilingual NLP. Groups
are expected to present for 5-10 minutes on ideas that they have. The implict
assumption is that this will be approximately 10 content slides. We 
understand that this is very early in the semester and that students have
not had a lot of exposure to all of the methods/datasets/algorithms/etc.
that are common in Multilingual NLP Research. With that being said,
students should have narrowed down the scope of the project to a specific
sub-field (i.e., Cross-Lingual Information Extraction, Multilingual
Spoken Language Understanding, etc.) though knowledge of state-of-the-art
methods for that task is not required. However, students are expected
to have identified at least one dataset that they will use. If desired, this
CAN be an English only dataset, but the final project will be cross-lingual or
multilingual, and disucssion of how to synthetically generate resources in
other languages using methods learned in the class will be required.

After each group presents, the next 15 minutes will be for class discussion
and questions related to the presentation. Success as a reseracher requires
communicating your scientific work in a variety of settings. Much of a 
researcher's job happens at coffees, meals, QA sessions after talks, hallways
of a conference, and visiting other institutions. This 15 minute format is
designed to highlight this skill which is often neglected in our formal
educational training. As such, a greater emphasis is on open-disucssion,
brainstorming, and iterating on problem ideas, rather than coming with a 
formal presentation.

Note that this proposal is only 5% of your final grade and that the format
is much more open-ended than most assignments. As such, grading of this
portion will be two-fold: coming prepared for 10 minutes with slides, and
a good-faith attempt at discussion with all of your classmates. The
understanding is that most groups will be able to get full marks if they
engage in discussions about their proposed work, as well as with the 
other groups. The one assumption is that the prepared remarks discuss
at least one METHOD/SUB-FIELD and at least one DATASET.

Interim Report
--------------

More Information Later about further expectations and deliverables,
but as a start:

<!-- For your interim report, you should have made substantial progress
on your project. For a survey, you should have read many of the papers,
identified main themes of the literature, and synthesized these into an 
outline. For an empirical project, you should have collected data, developed
baseline algorithms and metrics, and run preliminary experiments. Your 
interim report is an extension of your proposal, clarifying existing
material where requested, adding technical details of completed work, and 
outlining planned work. A reader should be able to answer these questions:

* What problem are you trying to solve or survey? Illustrate the problem with
examples and a give a precise technical description. Clearly identify inputs
and outputs. Be concise: if you don't hook your reader in the first paragraph
or so, they won't keep reading.

* Why is the problem important? If you could solve it, would you answer 
a scientific or mathematical question about language? Would you be able to 
build better, faster, or more usable systems than we can build now?

* Why is the problem hard? How do the obvious solutions fail? For an 
empirical project, answer this question by implementing and/ or running a 
baseline algorithm and analyzing the failure cases. For a survey paper, you
should find evidence in the literature.

* For an empirical paper: what is your proposed solution? Give a technical
description of your planned work, with enough detail that someone could
implement it. Your description should include an evaluation plan. For a 
survey paper: what are solutions that have been tried? Your description
should be convincing enough that your reader believes they'll learn
something interesting if they read all the way to the end of your 
(as yet unwritten!) final report.
-->

The interim report should look much like a conference or workshop paper, with
some of the technical details and experimental results missing. To get a feel
for this style, read some papers from [the syllabus](syllabus.html). None of
them are perfect, so read actively: what do you find good or bad
about the writing in each paper? Emulate the styles that you find effective, 
and avoid those that are unclear or pedantic. Here is some more advice:

* [On writing well](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser.
* [How to write a paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf) by Simon Peyton-Jones.
* [Mathematical writing](http://jmlr.org/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf) by Donald Knuth.

Final Project Report
--------------------------------------------

Your final project report should extend your interim report, filling in 
missing technical details, experiments, and analysis. We will make our
expectations explicit in our comments on your interim report.

Project Ideas
-------------

Many topics related to [Multilingual/Cross-Lingual/Cross-Language]+ [NLP/Speech/HLT]+
 are welcome. Some suggestions:

* Cross-Lingual Information Extraction
* Cross-Language Information Retrieval
* Multilingual Question Answering
* Cross-Lingual Semantics
* Typology and Phonolgy
* Code-Switching
* Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition
* Multilingual Spoken Language Understanding
* Representation Learning
* Multilingual Language Models
* Low-Resource

This is the Multilingual NLP class, and NOT the Machine Translation class, so
projects should be decidedly not MT. Much of the work will rely on MT as a part
of the pipeline, or as a baseline. However, overly translation focused projects
will be discouraged. We will make note of projects that rely too much on MT
during the proposal and interim reports so that groups have a chance to correct
course.

Group Work
----------
The assumption is that most groups will be of size 2. However, groups
of 1 and 3 are permitted. Scope of the projects ARE assumed to be
linear, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute.
